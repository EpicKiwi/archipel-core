Archipel Core is an experimental project, we don't really know where we are going;
So we try things out and see if it's cool to keep it.

## Contributing to µD3TN

Archipel Core is based on µD3TN and we support it's development.
If your feature is focused on the Bundle protocol implementation, an important missing features based on DTN standards that should be implemented to a larger audience than a single experimental projet (like Archipel Core) or any improvement of performance on the main codebase. Then, you may consider contributing to µD3TN on [gitlab https://gitlab.com/d3tn/ud3tn](https://gitlab.com/d3tn/ud3tn).
